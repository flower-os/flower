# FlowerOS

*A small learning OS*

## Setup

You will need:
 - [rustup](https://rustup.rs) and a nightly Rust (if yours doesn't work, then update to latest) build to compile;
 - The `rust-src` component from rustup;
 - [Xargo](https://github.com/japaric/xargo);
 - [nasm](http://www.nasm.us/);
 - ld;
 - [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) (to run in a virtual machine);
 - X server to run qemu;
 - GNU GRUB (grub-mkrescue);
 - GNU make;

## Building

You can make the iso with `make iso`, and launch qemu and run it with `make run`. To enable debug symbols,
add `debug=1` to the make command.
